# Project Overview

Flask React Template is a full-stack application that pairs a modular Flask backend with a React + TypeScript frontend. MongoDB is the primary data store, Celery + Redis handle background jobs, and both halves of the stack share a focus on layered, testable architecture.

**Stack:**

- **Backend:** Python 3.12 · Flask 3 · PyMongo · Pydantic · Celery
- **Frontend:** React 18 · TypeScript · Tailwind CSS · Axios
- **Infrastructure:** MongoDB · Redis
- **Build Tooling:** Webpack 5 · Pipenv · npm scripts
- **Testing:** Pytest + pytest-cov
- **Deployment:** Docker · Kubernetes

**Key Directories:**

- `/src/apps/backend` – Flask application and domain modules
- `/src/apps/frontend` – React single-page app
- `/tests` – Backend test suite (pytest)
- `/docs` – Architecture and operational documentation
- `/config` – Shared configuration and environment settings

## Build and Test Commands

```bash
# Launch backend, frontend, and workers together
npm run serve

# Run only the Flask API (Gunicorn with reload)
npm run serve:backend

# Run only Celery workers
npm run serve:worker

# Run only Celery beat scheduler (cron jobs)
npm run serve:beat

# Start Flower dashboard (worker monitoring UI at `localhost:5555`)
npm run serve:flower

# Start the React dev server with hot reload
npm run serve:frontend

# Build production bundles for both backend assets and frontend
npm run build

# Backend test suite with coverage (pytest)
npm run test

# Python linting (mypy + pylint)
npm run lint:py

# TypeScript / React linting
npm run lint:ts

# Markdown linting
npm run lint:md
```

Use `pipenv install --dev` (from `src/apps/backend`) to bootstrap backend tooling and `npm install` for frontend dependencies.

## Architecture Principles

### Backend Architecture

- **Modular Design:** Each domain module (account, authentication, application, task, etc.) under `modules/` owns its REST API, service, and persistence layers.
- **Layered Structure:** HTTP (Flask blueprints) → View → Service → Reader/Writer → Repository → MongoDB.
- **Encapsulation:** Only expose `*_service.py`, `types.py`, and module-specific exceptions. Everything under `internal/` is private.
- **Clear Data Models:** Use Pydantic models and dataclasses to validate inputs/outputs at the boundaries.

### Frontend Architecture

- **Layer-Based:** Pages → Components → Contexts → Services.
- **State Management:** Prefer React Context + hooks; avoid introducing Redux-like solutions without team approval.
- **Service Layer:** All API calls flow through typed service modules that convert JSON into domain models/interfaces.

## Review Guidelines

### General Programming Principles

#### 1. Code Documentation

- **DO** write comments that capture intent, invariants, or non-obvious design decisions.
- **DON'T** narrate what the code already states.

#### 2. Naming Conventions

- Follow PEP 8 for Python (snake_case functions & variables, PascalCase classes) and idiomatic TypeScript naming.
- Choose descriptive names that communicate purpose.
- Avoid verb-based names for Python classes or React components. Functions, methods, and hooks should be verbs (e.g., `load_account`, `fetchUserData`).

#### 3. Function Size and Complexity

- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility.
- Break apart routines that exceed ~50 lines or mix multiple concerns.
- Prefer clear helper names over comments explaining control flow.

#### 4. Object-Oriented & Layered Design

- Keep domain behavior alongside the data it manipulates (services, domain objects, Pydantic models).
- Avoid scattering related logic across shared utilities when it belongs to a specific module.

#### 5. Defensive Programming

- Avoid sprinkling `if value is None` / optional checks without understanding nullability.
- Validate inputs at module boundaries (Pydantic models, request schemas) and rely on the types afterwards.

#### 6. Encapsulation Over Utilities

- Place behavior within the relevant module (e.g., reader/writer helpers) instead of creating broad utility modules.

#### 7. Code Reuse

- Audit existing modules, services, and hooks before writing new ones.
- Extract shared logic rather than duplicating code across modules or components.

---

### Backend-Specific Guidelines

#### 8. Module Independence

- **DON'T** import from another module's `internal/` packages.
- **DO** rely on the public service API (`*_service.py`) or shared types.

#### 9. Database Indexes & Data Access

- Ensure MongoDB indexes cover every `find`, `find_one`, aggregation `$match`, or `sort` pattern.
- Declare indexes in the repository layer (`internal/store/*_repository.py`).

#### 10. API Design

- Favor RESTful CRUD semantics: `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` on resource nouns.
- Provide a single `update` method per resource that accepts a well-defined DTO instead of field-specific methods.

#### 11. Business Logic Placement

- Keep business rules in the service layer.
- Avoid embedding domain logic inside Flask views or CLI scripts—delegate to services.

#### 12. Background Jobs

- Use Celery workers for async job processing (document processing, entity extraction, etc.).
- Define workers in `modules/application/workers/` inheriting from `Worker`.
- Use cron schedules for recurring tasks (e.g., `cron_schedule = "*/10 * * * *"`).

#### 13. Query Efficiency

- Guard against N+1 queries by batching lookups or using aggregation pipelines.
- Push filtering into Mongo queries instead of post-processing large in-memory lists.

---

### Frontend-Specific Guidelines

#### 14. Styling Practices

- **DON'T** use inline styles.
- **DO** rely on Tailwind utility classes or shared CSS modules as needed.

#### 15. Component Contracts & Variants

- Avoid per-page style overrides. Create component variants/props for different presentations.
- Shared layout primitives should live under `src/apps/frontend/components` or `layouts` rather than page folders.

#### 16. Data Fetching & State

- Fetch data through service modules under `services/` or `api/`.
- Normalize API responses into typed models before storing them in state.
- Avoid performing side-effectful data fetching inside render without hooks.

#### 17. List Rendering Performance

- Batch API requests when rendering collections. Never fire N network calls for N items within a render loop.

## Security Considerations

- Never log or echo PII.
- Ensure protected routes are wrapped in authentication/authorization middleware (Flask decorators or blueprints).
- Validate and sanitize all incoming data; prefer Pydantic models for request bodies and query params.
- Use parameterized Mongo queries. Avoid building raw query strings with user input.
- Keep secrets in environment variables or Doppler; never commit credentials.

## Testing Requirements

- Add or update pytest coverage for new backend endpoints or services (`tests/modules/...`).
- Place integration tests alongside module directories under `tests/modules/<module>/`.
- Target ≥60% coverage (80% preferred). Pytest runs with coverage reporting via `npm run test` or `make run-test`.

## Commit and PR Guidelines

### Commit Messages

Format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

Where `<scope>` is optional.

```
feat(claims): add confidence bounds validation
^--^ ^----^   ^-----------------------------^
|    |        |
|    |        +-> Summary in present tense, imperative mood
|    +-> Scope: component or module affected
+-> Type
```

Types:

- `feat` — new feature for users
- `fix` — bug fix for users
- `docs` — documentation only
- `style` — formatting, no logic change
- `refactor` — code restructuring, no behavior change
- `test` — adding or updating tests
- `chore` — maintenance tasks
- `build` — build system or dependencies
- `ci` — CI configuration
- `perf` — performance improvements
- `revert` — reverts a previous commit

Breaking changes: add `!` after type:

```
feat(api)!: remove deprecated endpoint
```

Rules:

- 50 characters max for subject line
- Use present tense, imperative mood ("add" not "added")
- No period at end
- Write messages that communicate the why/purpose

Examples:

- `feat(account): add email verification flow`
- `fix(auth): preserve session on token refresh`
- `refactor(store): extract append-only writer`
- `docs: update deployment architecture guide`

### PR Title Format

PR titles follow the same semantic format as commit messages:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

This ensures consistency across commits, PRs, and changelogs. The title prefix also drives automatic labeling (see below).

### Auto-Labeling

PRs are automatically labeled based on title prefix via the `pr-labeler` workflow:

| PR Title Prefix              | Type Label                 | Semver Label    |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------- |
| `feat:`                      | `type: feat`               | `semver: minor` |
| `fix:`                       | `type: fix`                | `semver: patch` |
| `perf:`                      | `type: perf`               | `semver: patch` |
| `docs:`                      | `type: docs`               | —               |
| `style:`                     | `type: style`              | —               |
| `refactor:`                  | `type: refactor`           | —               |
| `test:`                      | `type: test`               | —               |
| `chore:`                     | `type: chore`              | —               |
| `ci:`                        | `type: ci`                 | —               |
| Breaking (`feat!:`, `fix!:`) | `type: feat` / `type: fix` | `semver: major` |

Choose your type carefully — it determines the label and semver impact.

### Pull Request Requirements

- PR titles must follow the semantic format above.
- Include a rationale and testing evidence in the PR body.
- Keep diffs focused on a single concern.
